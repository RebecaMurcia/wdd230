                <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
                <h3>Company Name: Our Place</h3>

                <p>White space is found in most areas of this site. The brand keeps a clean design by using thin and simple typography. 
                    Thin lines trascend in other elements such as icons and buttons. Of whites are used to create a little variation without
                    adding too much. The products are the protagonists given that the brand use their pictures to add pops of color. 
                    Small accents in the right elements make this design clean and minimal.  </p>

                <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <h3>Company Name: Benjamin Moore</h3>
                <div><a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank">www.benjaminmoore.com</a></div>
                 <img src="images/benjamin-moore.jpg" alt="Benjamin Moore website">
                <p>The screenshot above shows a block of text, a button, and an image. These elements
                were placed in away that the viewer followed a diagonal pattern to observe each element; 
                read first, then see the image. Hierarchy is also emphasized in the size and color of the elements.
                Notice how the text portion seems to be larger than the image. This illusion is created since
                the top part of the image (floating shelf on the grey side) is breaking a perceived blue block.
                This is a smart way to play with images and create visual hierachy</p>

                <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
                <h3>Company Name: Lone Fox</h3>
                <div><a href="https://lonefox.com/" target="_blank">www.lonefox.com</a></div>
                 <img src="images/lone-fox.jpg" alt="Lone Fox website">
                <p>At first glance the dark green color is contrasting with the lighter colors of the picture. 
                    Other details that create contrast are the font sizes and font styles. Even though this section
                is about the same topic, there's an impression that it is divided into two; the top being more simple and dainty,
                 and the bottom (the image) being more filled with detail.</p>
