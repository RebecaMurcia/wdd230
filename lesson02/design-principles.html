                <h2>Alma 8:15</h2>
                <p>15 Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice,
                     for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in 
                     keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy 
                     first message from him. Behold, I am he that adelivered it unto you.</p>

                <p>11 For it must needs be, that there is an aopposition in all things. 
                    If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be 
                    brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither 
                    good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, 
                    if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death,
                     nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.</p>
